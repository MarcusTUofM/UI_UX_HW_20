      </div><span  class="e36_177">NextStop is designed to be a trip planning tool. Many of these planning tools focus on just an individual and make sharing plans inconvenient. Additionally they lack convenient features that streamline the planning process. How might we develop our app, NextStop, into a solution that provides all the tools travelers and their companions need to plan their next trip.
  </span><span  class="e37_213">During our beginning user research, we discovered that traveling workers are overwhelmed by confusing and unintuitive information when planning their trip.
  Therefore, we believe that travelers need a convenient method of organizing their trips and that we might be able to help if we provide an innovative organizational tool.
  We might do this by creating an app that focuses on solving these issues. Doing this will allow our product to reduce the stress of our users and allow them to be worry free during their trip.

The placement and choice of colors also received feedback to make the appearance smoother on the eyes.</span>

After reflecting on feedback the navigation went through many changes until it reached one where it was seamless to use. The parts that make NextStop unique, its trip making and sharing features also received many iterations. It was important to make its key feature welcoming and easy to use.</span>
